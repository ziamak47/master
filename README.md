# install-wsl-and-ansible
The scripts will help you to install ansible on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

ItÂ´s very nice to run your playbooks from your Windows System.

## Steps to install

Run the *01_setup_wsl.ps1* in Powershell as an administrator.

Then type *WSL* to enter Windows Subsystem CLI and execute the *02_install_ansible.sh*
